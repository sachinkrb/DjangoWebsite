
Windows 10:
-----------------------------------------
Install Python. Put a check mark on Add to Path. Pip, the package manager should come  with it.

Open Powershell as Admin
python --version
#Should show python version, if it shows 2.x.x, you have to type python3 --version. 
#In that case for all commands below: replaces python with python3.

pip --version
#Checks the package manager for python

#CHANGE YOUR POWERSHELL to C:\> first!

python -m venv code
#Create a virtual environment inside the folder named 'code' created at the same time.

code\Scripts\Activate.ps1  
#its activate.bat if you are using Command Prompt instead of PowerShell.
#Activates the virtual enviornment with python and for python.

cd .\code\

pip install django
#installs latest django for your project.

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
#Upgrade PIP if it says so.

mkdir djangoproject
#The trend seems to be to create 'src' folder instead of 'djangoproject'. Its upto you! 
#Mine created in 'code' folder after cding into code folder.

cd .\djangoproject\

django-admin.py start project mysite .	
#Don't forget the '.' at the end.		
#'mysite' can be anything, you can name it 'code' sames as virtual enviroment or simply just the name of your website.

	pyenv.cfg
	\djangoproject
		manage.py
		\mysite
			init.py
			urls.py

#Folder structure should be pretty much similar to above.
#'pip freeze' command inside code folder will show if django is installed or not.
